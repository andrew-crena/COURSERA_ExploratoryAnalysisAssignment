# ExploratoryAnalysisAssignment


This assignment was to practice my ability to use base R graphics to explore a data set. 
The data come from UC Irvine, and are related to household electricity use throughout the day.
These plots helped me understand how power usage fluctuates throughout the day, it is not 
simply a consistent stream of use.

Thank you for reading my work!
